Last night I watched a Netflix original documentary, The Social Dilemma. The documentary is about the dark side of social media, the imperious effect of social media apps on the psyche of people who are using it. Now, it really intrigues me that it was created and produced by Netflix, which itself is an (almost)addiction inducing recommendation engine. Oh, the irony! It wasn't lost on me ðŸ˜„ Anyway, the issue is real, irrespective of who decides to put it out there. (another half-hearted attempt at witticism) 
<br />
<br />
**So, what exactly is the issue?** The concern is that social media apps are designed to manipulate people psychologically to spend more time on their applications. Now, the ad-serving business model is such that if a user spends a lot of time on the app, then there is a higher probability of ad(shown to the user on the app) clicks, subsequently ads being more effective in achieving what they are targeting for, and consequently, social media companies generating higher revenue(which is almost proportional to the efficacy of ads on their platform). To put it very simply, the social media companies(with primary revenue generation depending on the ad-serving business model) get more money if the users are addicted to their apps. 
<br />
<br />
Hence, the pain-point is this addiction to social media platforms. First, letâ€™s just talk about â€˜obsessionâ€™, is obsession always detrimental for people? Well... I think, yes and no, depending on the situation. Obsession and addiction are words with a negative connotation. Obsession can lead to good and bad things, but granted that it is not considered a good mental state to be in. An artist obsessed with creating a perfect piece can give us a great art in some cases, a group of scientists obsessed with trying to find the mysteries of the world(or even trying to cure cancer for example) can lead to some ground-breaking discoveries. But then a lover obsessed with her object(a person is a better word maybe) of affection generally brings misery of one or both, or someone obsessed with watching cat videos all day is most probably not getting any productive stuff done. Nonetheless, obsession in itself might not be so bad but the object of obsession might be. 
<br />
<br />
The minor theme is seeking validation from others. Well, I am a firm believer that this behavior is almost no good. Yes, one might give an example of a child who does good things to get the approval of her parents or teachers. Well, in that age when one canâ€™t really know and decide for oneself, I think this trait of seeking approval or validation can help build character and keep that child on the right track(well, what is right anyway? Rather something that is optimized for not bringing too much unhappiness to oneself and others). But once the child grows up and has enough sense and disposition to think for himself, he should be able to see that doing something for the sole purpose of getting validation doesnâ€™t seem right. But then these social media companies are trying very hard to manipulate the psyche of their users to get addicted to the validation feedback. And this is just evil in my opinion.
<br />
<br />
Thus, my feeble conclusion(feeble because my analysis is not super-thorough) is that that most of the social platforms are working against the usersâ€™ interests(by inducing addiction for information consumption and social validation) rather than for the interests of users(providing productive utility and connecting people for good). Maybe that is why, in this era, when more and more people are getting connected virtually and the virtual world is getting smaller, there is more and more polarization seeping through the real world and it is becoming more of a divided place. 

That is not to say that social networking does not have its own merit, it definitely does! Hopefully, in some future post, I will make a case in favor of social media(well, that is by attempting to figure out ways to minimize its flaws).
